     <p>1.Community Food Support (Feeding Programs)
        Streetlife Project has been running Children Feeding Program in Luangwa and Kapoto Compounds of Kitwe 
        for the last 11 years. The Program provides a high-protein food supplement to over 400.
         The link between poor diet and decreasing immunity to diseases exacerbated by HIV/AIDS is well known.
        The Feeding program also provides an opportunity of identifying and befriending children from vulnerable families.
         With a high chance of being abandoned and becoming Street Children
        The Feeding program is an opportunity to meet vulnerable orphans or children from very poor families
        in their own environment.
        From this children who consistently attend the feeding program are identified and continued follow ups are made to their families.
        Other needs such as educational support for children not attending school or Home-based 
        care for HIV/AIDS parents or guardians are identified and met. 
        The number of children benefiting from this program is continually rising and the Project engages interested 
        Organizations to </p>

            <p>Street KIDS Project:
            Street Life originally started as a Project to help children forced into the Streets as results of effect
            of HIV/AIDS and /or poverty. We aim to eliminate “Streetism” through rehabilitation and integration of Street 
            children back to their families. Social Services had identified Street life as a processing Center for Government’s 
            current Program of rehabilitating Street Children through Zambia National Service Camps. Our focus to provide; a ‘Drop In’
            Facility where children can receive friendship, food and counseling on getting off the Streets. In the last thirteen years 
            Streetlife has successfully reunited many Street Children with their families and also identified those most vulnerable 
            Children from the street that need long term rehabilitation and care. We work closely with other NGOs to alleviate the 
            problem of increasing numbers of vulnerable children on the Streets.
